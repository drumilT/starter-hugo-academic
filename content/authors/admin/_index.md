Previously, I graduated from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) with B.Tech in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/) and a Minor in Statistics. 

During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to have worked with Prof. [Sunita Sarawagi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/) and [Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/) on improving domain-specific words for long speeches, and with Prof. [Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/) on unsupervised disfluency correction with collaboration with IBM Research India.

I spent the summer of 2020 with [](https://research.google/teams/india-research-lab/)[Barzilay Group @MIT CSAIL](https://www.regina.csail.mit.edu/) working on Diverse Question Generation. In Summer 2019, I worked with Prof. [](http://mmcv.csie.ncku.edu.tw/~wtchu/)[Edward Chung@HKPolyU](http://www.ee.polyu.edu.hk/en/people_detail.php?name=UlasKARAAGAC&cid=1&id=26002) on Origin-Destination Matrix Prediction. I have also interned with the [Alistrah Group@IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/alistarh-group/) in Winter 2019 and contributed to domain adaptation and built tuning pipelines at [Tvarit GmBh](https://www.tvarit.com/) in Winter 2018, Summer 2021.
