abstract: Spoken language is different from written language in its style and
  structure. Disfluencies that appear in transcriptions from speech recognition
  systems generally hamper the performance of downstream NLP tasks. Thus, a
  disfluency correction system that converts disfluent to fluent text is of
  great value. This paper introduces a disfluency correction model that
  translates disfluent to fluent text by drawing inspiration from recent
  encoder-decoder unsupervised style-transfer models for text. We also show
  considerable benefits in performance when utilizing a small sample of 500
  parallel disfluent-fluent sentences in a semi-supervised way. Our unsupervised
  approach achieves a BLEU score of 79.39 on the Switchboard corpus test set,
  with further improvement to a BLEU score of 85.28 with semi-supervision. Both
  are comparable to two competitive fully-supervised models.

summary: We correct disfluencies from spoken text using unsupervised,
  semi-supervised learning and show our methods come close to supervised
  methods, in terms of BLEU score.
